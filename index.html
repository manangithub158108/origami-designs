       <h3> <i> Interesting facts about a panda are as follows :-</i> </h3> 
       <p> 1) It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes,
           over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is 
           sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid
        </p>

        <p> 2) Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, 
            or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, 
            they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, 
            or bananas along with specially prepared food.

        <h4>THIS IS A PICTURE OF CAMEL WHICH IS MADE BY ORIGAMI</h4>
       <h3> <i> Interesting facts about a camel are as follows :-</i> </h3> 
       <p> 1) A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears 
            distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back.
        </p>

        <p> 2) The word camel is also used informally in a wider sense, 
            where the more correct term is "camelid", to include all seven species of the family Camelidae
         </p>

         <p> 3) Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat 
             and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. 
             There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of 
             the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. 
             The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.
